Nine Men's Morris Game

This is an implementation of the Nine Men's Morris game, a classic two-player strategy board game. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board with the goal of creating mills—three of their pieces aligned in a row, column, or diagonal. When a player forms a mill, they can remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board.

Game Rules
1. Placing Phase: Players begin by placing their pieces one at a time on the board. The goal is to form mills while blocking your opponent's moves.

2. Moving Phase: After all pieces are placed, players can move their pieces along the straight lines of the board. Players must continue to aim for creating mills and removing opponent pieces.

3. Flying Phase: When a player is reduced to only three pieces, they can "fly"—move their pieces anywhere on the board, bypassing the usual movement restrictions.

4. Game End: The game ends when a player has fewer than three pieces left. The opponent wins.
